Uh-uh-uh
You ready B?
Let's go get 'em.
Look for me, young B,
Cruisin' down the west side highway
Doin' what we like to do our way,
Eyes behind shades this neckless the reason all of my dates been blind dates.
But today I've got my thoroughest girl with me,
I'm mashin' the gas, she's grabbin' the wheel,
It's true to the heart
She rides wit me the new Bobby and Whitney
Only time we don't speak is during "*x and the City"
She gets Carrie fever, but soon as the show's over
She's right back to being my soldier
Cuz' mommy's a rider, and I'm a rolla
Put us togetha, how they gon stop both us?
Whateva she lacks, I'm right over her shoulder
When I'm off track mommyi is keepin' me focused
So let's lock this down like it's supposed to be
The 03 Bonnie and Clyde, Hov and B,
holla

All I need in this life of sin is me and my girlfriend (me and my

boyfriend)

The problem is, you dudes treat the one that you lovin with the same respect that you treat the one that you humpin.
That ain't by nothin, if even you mad about somethin', it won't be that, oh no it won't be that.
I don't be at places where we comfy at with no be-atch, oh no you won't see that

And no I ain't perfect. Nobody walkin' this earths surfaces is
But girlfriend work with the kid.
I keep you workin that Hermes Birkin Bag.
Manolo Blahnik Timbs, aviator lens 600 drops, Hercedes Benz
The only time you wear burberry to swim
And i dont have to worry, only worry is him
She do anything necessary for him and I do anything necessary for her.
So don't let the necessary occur. Yep!

Talk to em B
::Beyonce::
If I was your girlfriend,
I'd be there for you if somebody hurts you, Even if that somebody was me, Yaa-hee.
Sometimes I trip on how happy we could be.
And so I put this on my life,
Nobody or nothing will ever come between us.
And I promise I'll give my life, my love and my trust if you was my boyfriend.
-Jay-Z-
One more time.
::Beyonce::

The air that I breathin', all that I believe in.
I promise I'll give my life, my love and my trust if you was my boyfirend.
